A class should have only one reason to change meaning it should have a single responsibility or purpose.

In Violation example, the UserManager class has four different responsibilities
 => Managing user data
 => Sending emails
 => Database operations
 => Generating reports

This creates problems because changes to email formatting, database schema, or reporting requirements would all required modifying the same class.


***In the SRP-compliant version***, each class has a single, well-defined responsibility:
 User: Represents user data
 UserRepository: Handles data persistence
 EmailService: Message email operations
 UserReportGenerator: Creates reports
 UserService: Coordinates the user registration workflow.

 Benefits of following SRP:
  Easier maintenance: changes to email logic only affect EmailService
  Better testability: Each class can be tested independently
  Improved resuability: EmailService ca be used for other email needs
  Reducing coupling: Classes depend on abstractions, no concrete implementations
  Clearer code organization: Each class has a clear, focused purpose.

  This separation makes the code more modular, maintainable, and follows the principle that each class should have exactly one reason to change.



*******Disadvantages of Following SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):******
1. Increased Complexity

More classes to manage: What was 1 class becomes 5+ classes
Complex object graphs: You need to wire together multiple dependencies
Harder to understand initially: New developers must understand how all pieces fit together

2. Over-Engineering Small Projects
For simple applications, SRP can be overkill:
python# Simple need: Store user and send email
# SRP approach: Create 5 classes, manage dependencies
# Reality: The simple violation might be perfectly adequate
3. Performance Overhead

More object creation: Each responsibility becomes a separate object
Additional method calls: Simple operations now involve multiple classes
Memory usage: More objects in memory vs. one consolidated class

4. Increased Development Time

More boilerplate code: Interfaces, dependency injection, setup
Design decisions: Deciding where each responsibility belongs
Testing overhead: More classes mean more unit tests to write

5. Dependency Management Issues

Circular dependencies: Classes might end up depending on each other
Tight coupling: Despite separation, classes still need to work together
Configuration complexity: Managing all the dependencies and their relationships

6. Premature Abstraction

YAGNI violation: "You Aren't Gonna Need It" - creating abstractions for changes that may never come
Harder to change: Sometimes having everything in one place makes refactoring easier
Analysis paralysis: Spending too much time deciding how to split responsibilities

7. Context Switching Overhead

Mental load: Developers must keep track of multiple classes for one feature
Navigation complexity: Jumping between files to understand a single workflow
Debugging difficulty: Tracing through multiple classes for simple operations

When SRP Might Be Overkill:

Small, stable applications that rarely change
Prototype or proof-of-concept code
Simple CRUD operations with no complex business logic
One-time scripts or utilities
Very small teams where code complexity isn't a major concern

The key is finding the right balance - apply SRP when the benefits (maintainability, testability, reusability) outweigh the costs (complexity, development time, performance). For simple projects, a pragmatic approach that violates SRP might be more appropriate.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes.
