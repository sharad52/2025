Open/Close principle
"""Software entities(classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification, meaning you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing, tested code."""


Critical Reasoning Analysis
Why the First Approach Fails:

Modification Requirement: Adding new payment types requires changing the PaymentProcessor class
Testing Burden: Every addition necessitates retesting the entire processor
Coupling: Payment logic is tightly coupled to the processor implementation
Violation of Single Responsibility: The processor handles multiple payment types directly

Why the Second Approach Succeeds:

Extension Through Abstraction: New payment methods implement the PaymentMethod interface
Closed Core Logic: The processor's core algorithm never changes
Composition Over Inheritance: Uses dependency injection and registration patterns
Decorator Pattern: Shows how complex behaviors can be layered without modification

Critical Limitations to Consider:
When OCP Might Be Overkill:

Simple systems where change frequency is low
Prototypes where flexibility isn't yet needed
Performance-critical code where abstraction overhead matters

Real-World Challenges:

Prediction Problem: You can't anticipate all future extension points
Over-Engineering Risk: Creating abstractions for changes that never come
Complexity Trade-off: More interfaces and classes to maintain

Strategic Application:
Apply OCP most rigorously to code areas with high change frequency and business criticality. The payment example demonstrates this well because payment methods frequently evolve in business applications.
The principle forces you to think in terms of stable abstractions and variable implementations, leading to more robust architectural decisions.
