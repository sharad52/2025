Senior-Level Insight:
OCP is powerful but can lead to overengineering if applied prematurely. For instance, using the Strategy pattern for a feature unlikely to change adds unnecessary complexity. Senior engineers should assess the likelihood of extension needs using domain knowledge and prioritize YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It) when appropriate. In Python, dynamic typing and duck typing can simplify OCP adherence without heavy interfaces.
